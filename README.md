# Selecting Brazilian cities to travel
This portfolio project showcases my expertise in data analysis through an in-depth examination of 3,175 Brazilian cities identified by the Brazilian Ministry of Tourism as key destinations in their public policy plan (Mapa do Turismo/Tourism Map).

## The Brazilian Tourism Map

The Brazilian Tourism Map is an instrument within the Tourism Regionalization Program that defines the area - territorial cut - to be worked on as a priority by the Ministry of Tourism within the scope of public policy development. In addition, the municipalities are categorized in order to identify the performance of the sector's economy in the municipalities based on five variables crossed in a categorization.

## The Categorization of Tourist Municipalities

The [Categorization of Tourist Municipalities](http://www.regionalizacao.turismo.gov.br/images/conteudo/Perguntas_espostas_Categorizacao_2019.pdf) is an instrument developed by the Ministry of Tourism (MTur) to identify the performance of the tourism sector economy in the municipalities that are included in the Brazilian Tourism Map. This instrument, foreseen as a strategy for the implementation of the Tourism Regionalization Program, allows for more accurate decision-making and the implementation of policies that respect the peculiarities of Brazilian municipalities.

The Categorization is based on a set of indicators that measure the economic performance of tourism in the municipalities, such as:
- The number of tourist arrivals
- The number of tourist nights
- The revenue generated by tourism
- The number of jobs generated by tourism

The municipalities are then classified into one of five categories, according to their performance:

<b> A </b> - Emerging Tourist Municipalities <br>
<b> B </b> - Developing Tourist Municipalities <br>
<b> C </b> - Consolidating Tourist Municipalities <br>
<b> D </b> - Tourist Municipalities of National Interest <br>
<b> E </b> - Tourist Municipalities of International Interest <br>

The Categorization is an important tool for the Ministry of Tourism to guide its policies and investments in the tourism sector. It also helps municipalities to better understand their tourism potential and to develop strategies to attract more tourists.

### 2021: The Latest Categorization
